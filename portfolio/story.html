            <p>All of these dishes call for eggs in their recipes. 
            </p>
    
            <p>From baked goods to breakfast items and hearty meals, eggs make up a large bulk of Americans’ diets. And yet, this quintessential food item is in crisis as egg prices continue to peak — $5 per carton as of January 1 — more than one year after bird flu outbreaks erupted in December 2024.</p>
    
            <p>H5N1, otherwise known as bird flu, is a strain of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) causing outbreaks in poultry across the U.S. The first cases of bird flu were reported in December 2024.

            <p>Since then, this supply chain disruption has led prices to continue soaring. Compared to prices in January 2024, the cost of purchasing a carton of eggs is 53% higher this year, according to ABC News. 
            </p>
    
            <p>In fact, when looking at the general trend of egg prices since 1980, it appears that prices have consistently been on the rise over the 30+ year period.
                However, the past five years lend themselves to the most dramatic spike.</p>
    
            <p>While prices affect businesses and individuals across the country because of eggs’ sudden inaccessibility, even those who might have the means to purchase $5 cartons of eggs find them at their local grocery stores. 
            </p>
            

            <p>Evanston is representative of this phenomenon as several of its grocery stores downtown, such as Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods, have entire shelves barren from the egg shortage caused by the bird flu.

        <div> 

            <p>I began my research into this topic by scouring the internet about the most relevant news to Evanston and Northwestern students. Because I had been noticing a trend in visiting grocery stores to buy eggs — only to find the aisles and shelves empty, especially later in the day — I opted to write a “story” centered around the bird flu and the consequent egg shortage. 
            </p>

            <p>In terms of visual production, I wanted to engage with the reader through fun visual elements and interactives that help readers understand the data better. So to fulfill the former role, I created a supplementary graphic (an animation of an egg cracking). I referred to existing egg animations/gifs I could find on the internet and drew/illustrated my animation frame-by-frame on Procreate. I then exported as a gif and inputted it in my story. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In creating my data visualization Flourish chart, I began by searching for data on egg prices and stumbled upon a graph displaying egg prices on FRED, which sourced its data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. I exported the data into a Flourish line chart and organized the data to better display the peaks of egg prices.
