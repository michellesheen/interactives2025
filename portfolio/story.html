        <p>Omelets, shakshukas, casseroles, steamed egg. 
        </p>

        <p>All of these dishes call for eggs in their recipes. 
        </p>

        <p>From baked goods to breakfast items and hearty meals, eggs make up a large bulk of Americans’ diets. And yet, this quintessential food item is in crisis as egg prices continue to peak at $5 per carton as of January 1 — more than one year after bird flu outbreaks erupted in December 2024. 
        </p>

        <p>H5N1, otherwise known as bird flu, is a strain of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) causing outbreaks in poultry across the U.S. The first cases of bird flu were reported in December 2024. 
        </p>

        <p>Since then, this supply chain disruption has led prices to continue soaring. Compared to prices in January 2024, the cost of purchasing a carton of eggs is 53% higher this year, according to ABC News. 
        </p>

        <p>In fact, when looking at the general trend of egg prices since 1980, it appears that prices have consistently been on the rise over the 30+ year period, the past five years lend themselves to the most dramatic spike. 
        </p>

        <p>While prices affect businesses and individuals across the country because of eggs’ sudden inaccessibility, even those who might have the means to purchase $5 cartons of eggs find them at their local grocery stores. 
        </p>

        <p>Evanston is representative of this phenomenon as several of its grocery stores downtown, such as Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods, have entire shelves barren from the egg shortage caused by the bird flu. 
        </p>
