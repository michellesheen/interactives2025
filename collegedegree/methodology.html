        <p>For this story, we knew we wanted to explore the value of college degrees, especially with how high tuitions have gotten in recent years and the scrutiny many institutions have faced. For the three of us, attending a university to get a bachelor’s degree was a no brainer, but we knew there are people entering the same fields that we are without that degree. 
        </p>

        <p>We began by searching generally for datasets and stories about the return of investment of a college degree, and found data published by the Education Data Initiative about the ROI of college, which became the basis of our story. We used some of the data directly from this source for our story and one of the interactives. For the other interactives, we researched the tuition of the most and least expensive schools in the country and the average salary post graduation for each of these schools. We then created our own data set using these numbers and used it to create interactives. We mimicked this process when searching for data about the cost of living in major US cities compared to the average salaries in those cities. After finding these numbers, we created our own data set and made an interactive. 
        </p>

        <p>We also knew for this story we wanted to gain some student perspective. We interviewed two Northwestern undergraduates, one specifically who significantly shifted her major to gain insight on why she did it and if there were any financial considerations. We also interviewed a professor who has done research on this topic and would be able to provide insight on what the data and statistics on this reveal. We attempted to interview a financial consultant in Evanston but it did not pan out. If we were reporting this story more fully with a longer timeframe, it would have been valuable to interview people who did not attend university and secured well-paying jobs. 
        </p>

        <p>We made sure to stay in communication throughout this project, sending updates of our progress and clearly designating roles and responsibilities to share the workload and ensure the story remained cohesive.
