        <p>	Following years of rising prices, Americans have become increasingly cost-conscious. Whether perusing grocery aisles or embarking on longer-term investments, consumers' resistance to higher costs has influenced more thoughtful spending habits. One investment that has come under particular scrutiny is the value of a bachelor’s degree.
            </p>

        <p>	Only one in four American adults believe it’s very important to complete a four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job in the current economic climate, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/05/23/is-college-worth-it-2/">2024 Pew Research Report</a>.

        <p>The majority of 25 to 34-year-old workers have not received a bachelor's degree and their earnings have begun increasing over the past decade following decades of decline. Growing earnings for non-college graduates coupled with increasing tuition prices and student debt beg the question: is a college degree worth it in today’s economy?
        </p>

        <p>Some students still consider those four years integral to long term success. In the face of college dropout success stories, Northwestern University Junior Caroline Brody said she still views college as providing a “level of perceived security.”
        </p>

        <p>“We’re inundated with success stories of naturally intelligent white men,” Brody said. “Steve Jobs, Bill Gates; the quintessential success stories of American life and industry. It’s easier to flood your feed with people like that, but generally, to make a good amount of money and to do it with a higher degree of certainty that success is on the horizon, to me, college is the way to go.”

        <p>	Northwestern Economics and Education Professor Scott Ogawa has researched this very question. He said college provides more than comfort and there actually is a causal relationship between more schooling and higher income. Evidence shows that each additional year of schooling correlates to roughly a 10 percent income increase, according to Ogawa. Recognizing that the evidence is not perfect, Ogawa can conclude that there is a strong need for a college education even in the current economic climate. 
        </p>

        <p>	“All signs actually point to school matters, and it makes a difference, and it makes us more productive, and it's good for individuals. It's good for society,” Ogawa said. “As crazy expensive as college is at least on average, it appears to be worth it. The lifetime earnings gains are so tremendous that spending hundreds of 1000s of dollars is a good investment.”

        <p>However, simply graduating from college and having a prestigious alma mater does not guarantee a high salary. 
        </p>

        <p>“I think it’s a total fallacy that having Northwestern on your resume necessarily gets you a job,” Brody said. “Northwestern students in the aggregate probably do get interviews at a higher rate than other universities. If we’re talking about the first job out of college, yes it will be a great job and initially, there might be a bit of a boost, but I think in the long run it’s not a monstrous advantage.”
        </p>

        <p>And there are factors beyond just the piece of paper confirming you completed all four years. Ogawa said that, with the goal of maximizing fiscal gains, students should take careful consideration of their choice of major.
        </p>

        <p>“It's not a slam dunk, but your major is almost more important than the sort of selectivity of your college,” Ogawa said. “Major really matters. Anyone who says otherwise is willfully ignorant.”

        <p>Northwestern Senior Caroline DeRose said she came to college knowing she had to strategically choose her area of study.
        </p>

        <p>“I originally pursued engineering because it was definitely a guaranteed decent salary,” DeRose said. “I needed assurance that I would have a steady salary going into college because I didn’t have any financial security for after I graduate, so I just never saw myself pursuing anything besides medicine or engineering growing up because I knew I would need the money.”
        </p>

        <p>However, as she went through college and her interests changed, one facet of her decision-making process remained constant: financial security. DeRose is graduating from McCormick School of Engineering this spring and beginning law school in the fall.
        </p>

        <p>“I didn’t switch because of the money, but knowing that I will still have a guaranteed salary [definitely] played a big role in my decision making, because I would not have switched into the legal field if that meant losing my engineering salary,” DeRose said.
        </p>

        <p>	There are many reasons to pursue a career, but the harsh reality is there are fiscal sacrifices to these choices. The cultures surrounding college applications and major and minor selection conceal the reality that these choices have a strong impact on long-term earnings, Ogawa said. 
        </p>

        <p>“These facts are not the kind of things you would want to advertise to seniors during the process because this is real life. This stuff matters. I'm sorry, but if you feel like your life has been crushed, you still have a good life in front of you. The US has many good opportunities, but [college] does matter,” Ogawa said. “And then the other one is once you get here, I think for sure you get told lies about the major not mattering…I think a lot of places basically just willfully ignore the evidence and tell you your major doesn't make a difference.”
