        <p>Following years of rising prices, Americans have become increasingly cost-conscious. Whether perusing grocery aisles or embarking on longer-term investments, consumers' resistance to higher costs has influenced more thoughtful spending habits. One investment that has come under particular scrutiny is the value of a bachelor’s degree.
        </p>

        <p>Only one in four American adults believe it’s very important to complete a four-year college degree in order to get a well-paying job in the current economic climate, according to a 2024 Pew Research report.</p>

        <p>The majority of 25 to 34-year-old workers have not received a bachelor's degree and their earnings have begun increasing over the past decade following decades of decline. Growing earnings for non-college graduates coupled with increasing tuition prices and student debt beg the question: is a college degree worth it in today’s economy?
        </p>

        <p>“I think it’s a total fallacy that having Northwestern on your resume necessarily gets you a job,” Brody said. “Northwestern students in the aggregate probably do get interviews at a higher rate than other universities. If we’re talking about first job out of college, yes it will be a great job and initially, there might be a bit of a boost, but I think in the long run it’s not a monstrous advantage.”
